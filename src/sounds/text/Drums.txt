SJC Custom Drums. 14x7 inches (14″x7″)
The hoop is aluminum.
It is based on an older file I uploaded on my snarepack on the freesound.org page.
I looped the attack (it has a double attack).
It is a non-edited file in respect of eq.
It doesn't have enough bass. It's better to use it as a layer.

Based on the file

https://freesound.org/people/Logicogonist/sounds/805911/

blended with a pitch shifting (mid to bass) sinewave.

The attack has an extra fading mid-high sinewave.

The middle of the sine is louder because the overall pitch shifting sinewave envelope oscillates at an inaudibly low frequency.

  Sound effects > Objects / House appliances
A punchy kick sound created entirely with the mouth, recorded using the built-in microphones on the Zoom H4N. This raw, unprocessed sample captures a clean, low-end thump perfect for percussion layering, beatboxing, or experimental sound design. Ideal for adding an organic kick element to your track.

 Korg Electribe Emx2 - Kick
these are samples from the new korg electribe emx2 music production station not the best recording quality but some nice sounds anyway the weird naming is due to the autoslice function in renoise wich i used to separate the samples from a one shot recording
